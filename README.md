# Beat-The-Clock
This is my own version of Brad Traversy's Word Beater Game.
> Simple speed typing app built with JavaScript

## Usage
Run Index.html in a browser or go here: [Beat The Clock](https://austinmoore1492.github.io/Beat-The-Clock/)

 ## Updates
 I added some functionality so when you type a word it flashes green when the word is correct. 
 There were issues where the same word would get played in a row and you wouldn't realize it was the same word that needed to be typed.
 Also added some commonly misspelled words, definitely for example, to help others spell them correctly.
